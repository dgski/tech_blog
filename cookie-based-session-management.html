Which for a beginner was great, but a lot of the fundamental aspects of back-end development had been abstracted from me, and I found annoying discrepancies between my knowledge and know-how. Sessions were one element I had neglected. I had taken them for granted; somehow magically some level of state is maintained between the server and the client.</p><p>It wasn’t till I started writing my <a href="https://github.com/dgski/baseketbase-agg">News Aggregator</a> Project in <a href="https://racket-lang.org">Racket</a> that I realized I don’t really know how sessions work. Racket’s a great language, but it’s not exactly popular and doesn’t have any web frameworks. I needed to learn and write my own session manager. So I did.</p><p>How exactly does the server know whether a given client is logged in? Turns out it’s mainly about <strong>cookies</strong>. Cookies are small collections of data that the server asks the client to store. They are transmitted in the HTTP request headers under the <strong>Cookie</strong> section, and held by the browser on the client’s end.</p><p>For sessions, the server generates a session id, tells the client to remember it, the client does so and attaches that sid to following requests, so the server knows whether a request belongs to an authenticated session or not.</p><p>To better understand how this works; let’s write a simple HTTP request handler. We will use the basic web server provided in python’s <strong>http.server</strong> package.</p><p>We will start with three elements:</p><ul><li>address: this is the address and port at which the server will listen for connections</li><li>handler: this is a class which has the necessary methods to handle requests</li><li>server: we will initialize the built-in <strong>HTTPServer</strong> object with our address and handler.</li></ul><p>Finally, we will start our server using the <strong>serve_forever()</strong> method:</p><pre><code class="language-python">from http.server import *

#Setup
address = (&#39;&#39;, 8000)
handler = BaseHTTPRequestHandler
server = HTTPServer(address, handler)

#Start
server.serve_forever()
</code></pre><p>We can send a request to our new server using a browser at <strong>localhost:8000</strong>. However, we should still the following error:</p><pre><code class="language-text">Error response

Error code: 501

Message: Unsupported method (&#39;GET&#39;).

Error code explanation: HTTPStatus.NOT_IMPLEMENTED -
Server does not support this operation.
</code></pre><p>Looks like our handler can’t handle simple <strong>GET</strong> requests… We need to do something about that. Define a new class at the top of the file. We still use <strong>BaseHTTPRequestHandler</strong> as the parent class, but add the <strong>do_GET()</strong> method:</p><pre><code class="language-python">
class SessionHandler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        self.response = 200
        self.send_header(&#39;Content-type&#39;,&#39;text/html&#39;)
        content = &quot;Hello&quot;
        self.wfile.write(bytes(content, &quot;utf-8&quot;))
</code></pre><p>Remember to change the handler to our new class:</p><pre><code class="language-python">handler = SessionHandler
</code></pre><h2 id="dispatching">Dispatching</h2><p>Now if you visit again with your browser, you should now see the raw text, “Hello” displayed. That’s a good start, but we need our server to do different things based on different URL paths. Let’s add a simple dispatcher and methods to handle the paths:</p><pre><code class="language-python">class SessionHandler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        routes = {
            &quot;/login&quot;:   self.login,
            &quot;/logout&quot;:  self.logout,
            &quot;/&quot;:        self.home
        }
        try:
            response = 200
            content = routes[self.path]()
        except:
            response = 404
            content = &quot;Not Found&quot;
            
        self.send_response(response)
        self.send_header(&#39;Content-type&#39;,&#39;text/html&#39;)
        self.end_headers()
        self.wfile.write(bytes(content, &quot;utf-8&quot;))
        return
    
    def home(self):
        return &quot;Welcome Home&quot;

    def login(self):
        # todo: perform login
        return &quot;Logged In&quot;

    def logout(self):
        # todo: perform logout
        return &quot;Logged Out&quot;
</code></pre><p>Okay, things are taking shape. Let’s run through what was added:</p><ul><li>The <strong>routes</strong> dictionary has paths as keys and page methods as values.</li><li>We use the <strong>try,except</strong> statement to try to access the methods using the path. If it works, we set <strong>response</strong> to 200 (success) and prepare our content. Otherwise, we set <strong>response</strong> to 404 (not found) and set content to <strong>Not Found</strong>.</li><li>The home, login and logout methods return a text string representing themselves.</li></ul><h2 id="logging-in">Logging In</h2><p>Now let’s implement our login process. After a user logs in, the time spent logged in is referred to as a <strong>session</strong>. For each login and consecutive logout, we will have a unique session id (sid). So obviously, our next immediate step is to generate a new <strong>sid</strong> when the user clicks on login. We will use a dictionary to store our sessions ids. Usually a database fulfills this role, but for our simple purposes, this should be enough. For incredibly basic security import the randint function:</p><pre><code class="language-python">from random import randint
</code></pre><p>Add the following method to generate the sid:</p><pre><code class="language-python">def generate_sid(self):
    return &quot;&quot;.join(str(randint(1,9)) for _ in range(100))
</code></pre><p>Add a global dictionary to the top of the file:</p><pre><code class="language-python">sessions = {}
</code></pre><p>Make the following changes to the <strong>login</strong> method:</p><pre><code class="language-python">def login(self):
    # Password normally be checked here
    sid = self.generate_sid()
    self.cookie = &quot;sid={}&quot;.format(sid)
    sessions[sid] = {&quot;username&quot;, &quot;useragent&quot;,&quot;ip address&quot;,&quot;expiry&quot;}
    return &quot;Logged In&quot;
</code></pre><p>Add the following <strong>send_header</strong> function calls to bottom of the <strong>do_GET</strong> method:</p><pre><code class="language-python">def do_GET(self): 
    #...
    self.cookie = None # Addition
    self.send_response(response)
    self.send_header(&#39;Content-type&#39;,&#39;text/html&#39;)
    if self.cookie:
            self.send_header(&#39;Set-Cookie&#39;, self.cookie) # Addition
    self.end_headers()
    self.wfile.write(bytes(content, &quot;utf-8&quot;))
    return
</code></pre><p>What is happening should be clear: <strong>login()</strong> is setting the <strong>self.cookie</strong> member variable to a random string of numbers, and <strong>self.send_header(‘Set-Cookie’, self.cookie)</strong> is sending it off as a cookie value. Now if you visit <strong>/login</strong> in your browser, and open up the web inspector, you should see <strong>sid</strong> as a cookie, with the value as whatever you generated. This cookie is held by the browser, and will be forwarded to our server with every request. It provides ‘context’ between requests.</p><p>Also, notice that <strong>login()</strong> adds the sid to the dictionary as a key with a dummy dictionary <strong>{“username”, “useragent”,”ip address”,”expiry”}</strong> as a value. This is where a complete session manager would store those pieces of information about the user, to later verify the session. Add this on your own.</p><h2 id="validating-users">Validating users</h2><p>Now we need to perform the most fundamental aspect of session management: validating a session. Let’s say there is some content that only registered, logged in users can see. We don’t want our user to have to provide their password with each page request; That would be incredibly cumbersome. We need to check if a request contains a session and display the right thing. We need to extract a header’s sid to get that information. Add the following method to our <strong>SessionHandler</strong> class:</p><pre><code class="language-python">def parse_cookies(self, cookie_list):
    return dict(((c.split(&quot;=&quot;)) for c in cookie_list.split(&quot;;&quot;))) if cookie_list else {}
</code></pre><p>This will nicely extract the cookies string from the request and put it into a dictionary for our convenience. Also alter our <strong>do_GET</strong> <strong>try</strong> block so it looks like this:</p><pre><code class="language-python">try:
    response = 200
    cookies = self.parse_cookies(self.headers[&quot;Cookie&quot;])
    if &quot;sid&quot; in cookies:
        self.user = cookies[&quot;sid&quot;] if (cookies[&quot;sid&quot;] in sessions) else False
    else:
        self.user = False
    content = routes[self.path]()
</code></pre><p>Our home page should display whether a user is currently logged in:</p><pre><code class="language-python">def home(self):
        return &quot;Welcome User!&quot; if self.user else &quot;Welcome Stranger!&quot;
</code></pre><p>What is happening here? Take a closer look at the try block. There are a few interesting things happening within:</p><ul><li>As before, we are setting the response to code 200, which for a HTTP request, it means that the page was found</li><li>Secondly, we are parsing the <strong>Cookie</strong> section of the header. Our <strong>parse_cookies</strong> method splits the Cookie string by “;” to seperate the individual cookies, then it puts the cookie ids and their values into a dictionary. If there are no cookies, it responds with an empty dictionary</li><li>Next, our try block checks if “sid” is in the <strong>cookies</strong> dictionary. If it isn’t, it sets <strong>self.user</strong> to false. Otherwise, it then checks whether the sid value stored in the <strong>sessions</strong> global.</li><li>From then on, it’s business as usual.</li></ul><p>We have altered a fundamental behaviour of our micro-program: when we visit the homepage without a generated sid cookie being broadcast by the browser we will see:</p><pre><code class="language-text">&quot;Welcome Stranger!&quot;
</code></pre><p>Clearly, unless the sid is stored in the <strong>sessions</strong> dictionary, the application instance does not recognize the web user. But if the user logs in using the rudimentary <strong>/login</strong> page, it will display:</p><pre><code class="language-text">&quot;Welcome User!&quot;
</code></pre><p>Try logging in, and then restarting our server. If you return to the home page, it won’t recognize you, even if the browser holds and sends a <strong>sid</strong> cookie. Because the dictionary dies with the process, our server completely forgets about the session. If you visit the <strong>login</strong> page again, a new <strong>sid</strong> is generated, and we get <strong>“Welcome User!”</strong>.</p><p>To Recap: the login process generates a new sid, saves the users information(user agent, ip address, etc), and sends back a header asking for the user’s browser to remember the new sid. Of course to be useful in most cases, you would have to validate a login password before generating the sid and continuing, but the fundamental aspects of session management are already present.</p><h2 id="logging-out">Logging Out</h2><p>What if the user wants to end their session? Well, we should probably give them a log out page as well. Let’s add something to our currently useless logout page:</p><pre><code class="language-python">    def logout(self):
        if not self.user:
            return &quot;Can&#39;t Log Out: No User Logged In&quot;
        self.cookie = &quot;sid=&quot;
        del sessions[self.user]
        return &quot;Logged Out&quot;
</code></pre><p>This method will check if a valid user is logged in, set the cookie to empty and delete the session id from the <strong>sessions</strong> dictionary, before returning the <strong>“Logged Out”</strong> text.</p><p>Check out what happens now: restart our your server application, open it and validate the following happens in order:</p><ol><li>On First Visit of the home page <strong>“/“</strong> it should display: “Welcome Stranger!”.</li><li>If you now visit <strong>“/login”</strong>, it should display “Logged In”, check your cookies for the “/“ domain, you should see an <strong>sid</strong> cookie with the newly generated session.</li><li>Now if you visit the home page, your should see: “Welcome User!”. Congratulations, your session has been validated!</li><li>Next test if the <strong>“/logout”</strong> page works. Visit it, it should say “Logged Out”. Make sure it worked by once again checking your cookies in your browser. The <strong>sid</strong> cookie should be empty.</li><li>If you visit the home page again, it should display: “Welcome Stranger!”. You have successfully logged out.</li></ol><p>The complete code should now look like:</p><pre><code class="language-python">from http.server import *
from random import randint
